# Project 4 - *TwitterApp*

**TwitterApp** is a basic twitter app to read and compose tweets the [Twitter API](https://apps.twitter.com/).

Time spent: **18** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] User can sign in using OAuth login flow
- [X] User can view last 20 tweets from their home timeline
- [X] The current signed in user will be persisted across restarts
- [X] In the home timeline, user can view tweet with the user profile picture, username, tweet text, and timestamp.
- [X] Retweeting and favoriting should increment the retweet and favorite count.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [X] User can load more tweets once they reach the bottom of the feed using infinite loading similar to the actual Twitter client.
- [X] User should be able to unretweet and unfavorite and should decrement the retweet and favorite count.
- [X] User can pull to refresh.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] Add images to tweets
- [X] Add links to tweets
- [X] Add StackView to hide/show images and links
- [X] User can click on link and redirect to the url on Safari

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. Using StackView
2. Easier way to implement Retweet/Favorite

## Video Walkthrough

## Notes

Implementing StackView to the app was challenging. Issues with retweeting/favoriting made this app challenging to develop as well.
